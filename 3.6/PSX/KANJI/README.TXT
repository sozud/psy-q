  tool for PlayStation.
          Font:  Gothic
          Size:  11, 13, 15 dots
          Type:  Non-KANJI				got1[135]j0b
                 The first level KANJI			got1[135]j1b
                 The second level KANJI			got1[135]j2b
                 Character for vertical writing		got1[135]tat
                 Half-size characters (hankaku)		got1[135]hlf
                 User-defined character			got15gai
  
  The data files described above are included in 'fontdata\*.h'.

< How to use >
 0. KANJI font data format 
   Refer to 'fontdata\format.doc' for KANJI font data structure and the
   file structure.
   Also, half-size character array is described in 
  'fontdata\hankaku.doc'.

 1. Built-in KANJI font data in PlayStation
   PlayStation contains the 15-dot font data; non-KANJIs, the first 
   level KANJIs and the user-defined characters. Make use of the built-in
   data with an access function (Krom2RawAdd2()) distributed before.
   (Refer to \psx\doc\jp\api.) 
Å@ The tool for displaying KANJI codes and data can be used, too.
   (sjiscode\codeview.cpe)
    Note: In this tool the Krom2RawAdd2() function is used for the access
          to the user-defined characters added for overseas PlayStation.
          The specification is the same as Krom2RawAdd(), and it 
          corresponds to every code in the non-KANJIs, first level
          KANJIs and user-defined characters. 

 2. Necessary KANJI font data only
   As for the font data distributed this time, the case is assumed that 
   only the necessary data is extracted from all the font data, and that 
   the extracted data is used in each application. 
   The tool for extracting the necessary font data for kanjidiv, and 
   viewer for the extracted data are attached to this document. However, 
   the characters for vertical writing and the half-size data (hankaku) 
   are not included.

 3. KANJI data files by font size 
   As a reference, a sample for handling KANJI data files by font size 
   is included in kanjifnt.
