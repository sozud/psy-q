Thease programs are the sample code for playing back MDEC MOVIE data
on the STR format.

[Explanation of files]

tuto0.c
	The minimum set of playing back movie rutine.
		There are following limitations.

		1 The resolutions of movie are multiples of 16.
		2 There is no dynamic resolution changes.

tuto1.c
	This code have more funcions than tuto0.c
		Extended fuctions are followings.

		ÅEThe parameters for playing back are structured.

		ÅEFree resolutions,but in the 24 bit mode the horizontal
		  resolution must be even.

tuto2.c
	Added the on-memory-streaming function to tuto0.c

	O button pressed
		Stop updating Ring buffer by setting 0 to end_frame of
		StSetStream().
		And playing back the loop movie on the Ring buffer by
		StGetNextS(), ON MEMORY STREAMING.

	X button pressed
		Back to normal play , update the Ring buffer data again.



tuto3.c

	This program is the same as tuto0.c, but avoids frame skipping. 
	This skipping frame is caused by a full a ring buffer.

	Basic idea is as follows:

	When the decode speed is severe,access a little backwoard.
	So the transfer rate from CD is reduced and the ring buffer full
	state will be avoided.

	But using access to CD , you can't use this method for the
	movie with XA audio because the noise will be generated.
	And this sample only run StModeStream2 mode.
	
	This sample is profit for decoding non-skipping frame without
	XA audio.

	In the program I use StRingStatus() and StGetBackloc() fuction
	supported ver 3.4 library later.

	When there are few free sectors reported by StRingStatus,
	you access backward location reported by StGetBackloc().
	These codes are followings.

	StRingStatus(&free,&over); /* added ring buffer status */
        if(free<MINIMUM_FREE_SECTORS) {
	    next_frame = StGetBackloc(&backloc); /* get the latest frame
						    loc and id on ring buf*/
	    StSetMask(1,next_frame,0xffffffff); /* masking from cdrom data */
            /* access backward to reduce trasfer rate */
	    strKickCD(&backloc);
	}

	You must call these codes frame by frame.

	You must set RING_SIZE larger than tuto0.c not to stop movie
	while accessing. You should set RING_SIZE - MINIMUS_SECTORS
	to includes 7 or 8 FRAMEs.

	You must MINIMU_SECTORS lager than 1 FRAME sector size because
	frame will be skipped before you access backward CD.





[How to run]
	(In the case of tuto0.c)

	psymake tuto0 		(compile)
	run tuto0		(run)


[How to play]
	running the program,imediately play back the movie.
	press select button ,exit the program.


[program explanations]

	This program play back movie data on the STR foramt.
	There are two mode for playing back movie,1st mode is 16 bit/pixel
	and 2nd mode is 24bit/pixel. if you define the 'RGB24' which is
	the macro in the program, the mode is set 24 bit/pixel mode.

	If you change the number of frames to play back , you change the
	END_FRAME macro in the program.

	NOTE!: END_FRAME is 2 or 3 less than the correct end point because
		of unexpectedly lost the frame.
