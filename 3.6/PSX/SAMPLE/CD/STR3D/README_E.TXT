[comments]
	If you define BG in tuto0.c , streamed data is mapped for BG.
	If you define TEXTURE in tuto0.c , streamed data is mapped for
	16 bit texture of the object.

	In library version 3.2 later , you can call DecDCTvlcSize().
	This function limits the size of VLC decode at one time , so
	you can control the load for decodeing.

	If you set the size of limitation of VLC decoding by calling
	DecDCTvlcSize larger , animation will be smooth but 3D graphics
	frame rate will be reduced.
	On the other hand , if you set the size smaller , animation will
	be not smooth but 3D part will be smooth.
	Please decide the size of VLC decoding case by case.
