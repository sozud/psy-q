	This sample is similar to the MOVIE\TUTO2.c sample.  However, 
        program operates in the following way:  

          1) The STR is usually read from the CD-ROM, and replayed.
          2) When a button is pressed, CD-ROM access is stopped.
          3) and the replay is continued by using the data which 
             remains in the RING BUFFER.

        This shows "On Memory STR".  This sample is different than
        the MOVIE\SAMPLE because it explains STR algorithm and is helpful
        if you are making an original streaming. 

        In the future this sample will be modified to read the CD-ROM
        data instead of the data file.
