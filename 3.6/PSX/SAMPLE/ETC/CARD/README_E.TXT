Sample Program for Memory Card


< Overview >

This sample program is the extract from the Memory Card Management Tool
built into the PlayStation (The US screen design is used).  A part of 
the actual source code is disclosed for reference of writing 
the Memory Card access program.

Both screen image and Memory Card handling are the same as for 
the PlayStation. 

Since only the Memory Card handling module source code can be disclosed, 
for other modules, such as Menu System handling module, libraries are 
provided instead.  Please refer to the attached document for details of 
the libraries. 

Icon Generation Tool for the Memory Card Screen is also included.
Please make use of it as necessary.

1.How to execute Memory Card Screen Sample Program
  (You should have the DTL-H2080 Controller Box, which has 
  the memory card slots.)

  	
  Compile the sample program under the subdirectory "max\".
  Default compilation environment is used. If necessary, modify 
  "makefile.mak" and "main.lnk" according to the location of 
   your "\psx\lib" directories.

	> cd max
	> psymake

  After compilation, execute the program.

	> run main


  Memory Card Screen will appear followed by a blank screen for a few 
  second.

       	O,X,square,triangle Buttons   Select item
       	START Button		      Cancel
	SELECT Button		      End sample program	
        L1,L2,R1,R2 Buttons           Cancel DELETE
