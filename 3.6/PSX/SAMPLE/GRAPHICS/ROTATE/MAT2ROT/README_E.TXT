Get Euler's angles from rotation matrix

*overview

This sample gives an function example "InvRotMatrixZYX()" which is
opposite of RotMatrix().


Left square (square-A) rotates by control pad directly.
Right square (square-B) rotates as follows:


pad => Euler's angles-A => rotation matrix A => Left square(A)'s coordinate

             |
             v

       InvRotMatrixZYX()

             |
             v

       Euler's angles-B => rotation matrix B => Right square(B)'s coordinate


This sample assumes the order of rotation is Z, Y, then X-axis
(as RotMatrix()).

As there are one or more Euler's angles each rotation matrix, angles-B 
may not be same as angles-A.
