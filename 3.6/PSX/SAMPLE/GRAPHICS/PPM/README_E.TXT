SAMPLE PROGRAM FOR FLAT TEXTURE SQUARE PERSPECTIVE MAPPING
<Description>
	This sample programs performs the texture mapping without distortion by
	perspective conversion of the square bit by bit.
	Currently, the function below in the jimen sample can perform faster texture
	mapping.
			draw_general_square


<How to operate>
	PADRup/down:	Rotation about Z-axis
	PADRleft/right:	Rotation about Y-axis
	PADl/PADn:	Translation in Z-axis direction
	PADLup/down:	Translation in Y-axis direction
	PADLleft/right:	Translation in X-axis direction
