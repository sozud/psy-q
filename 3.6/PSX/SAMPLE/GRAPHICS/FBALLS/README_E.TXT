		Fast balls 


This is a sample program based on "balls" program for decreasing the drawing 
time.

Changes from the original balls program are as follows:

	o The display mode was changed to 640x480.

	o The sprite primitives of balls were changed to semi-transparency.

And the following 3 points were changed for decreasing the drawing time.

	o To decrease the time of V-BLNK, 242 was put into h member of
	  struct screen of struct DISPENV.
	  By changing the display position between V-RAM and Display,
	  the time of V-BLNK could be decreased.

	o The amount of drawing to V-RAM was decreased by changing
	  the drawing heignt to 464.
	  By this change, the clipping area could be large and the amount
	  of drawing to V-RAM would be decreased.

	o By using DrawOTagEnv() to do PutDrawEnv and DrawOTag at the same
	  time, the overhead of interruption was decreased.

By these changes, the drawing time could be decreased a little as follows.
