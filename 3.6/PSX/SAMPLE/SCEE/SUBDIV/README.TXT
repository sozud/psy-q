
Hi there fellow station coders...


Here is a SHADY bit of source code to subdivide your polygons, it comes
in handy when your polys get big and are distorting / disappearing.

The reason I`ve uploaded this is because I tried using 'SubPol3' and
'SubPol4' in libgte.lib and they are very very slow... :)


Examine the C code closely and I`m sure you'll find it easy to
implement into your own code. I coded this routine a while back for the
game 'ShellShock', this version was slotted into 'BLAM' in a matter of
minutes.

>Has anyone managed to subdivide the RGB values properly on a GT3 or
>GT4? This code will only subdivide the RGB values correctly if red,
>green and blue are all the same... any ideas? EMAIL please...
