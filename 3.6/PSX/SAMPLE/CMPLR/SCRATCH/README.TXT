  This is a sample program showing the use of the scratch pad area (RAM in CPU)
  A simple memory access test is performed.
  By pressing the circle or the X button, the test mode is changed.
 
  (A) SCRACH PAD ACCESS 1 ( test0() )
      Access to the scratch pad.
      Indirect access using a pointer is performed.
 
  (B) SCRACH PAD ACCESS 2 ( test1() )
      Access to the scratch pad.
      Direct access using variable attributes is performed.
 
  (C) MAIN MEMORY ACCESS ( test2() )
      Access to standard main memory.
 
      The LOOP COUNT value becomes larger the faster the execution is.
 
      (Note)
     When this sample is compiled with the "-O0" (no optimization) option (see
     makefile.mak), the execution speeds of the programs are as follows 
     (going from fastest to slowest):
		      (A) > (B) > (C)
     However, when compiling is done with the "-O3" option, the speeds are:
     		      (A) = (C) > (B)
     Thus, it cannot always be said that the use of the scratch pad area
     necessarily
     leads to improvements in execution speed. This sample is just an 
     example, and the question of which methods perform the best depends 
     on the specific code and degree of optimization.
